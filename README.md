Statistics for Data Science with Python
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and datasets designed for learning and applying statistical concepts using Python. The labs cover fundamental topics from descriptive statistics and probability to hypothesis testing and regression analysis.

Notebooks
1. Introduction_to_probability_distribution.ipynb

Introduces probability distributions, focusing on the Normal Distribution and using scipy.stats for calculations.

2. Visualizing_Data.ipynb

Covers data visualization techniques using seaborn and matplotlib, including identifying duplicates, and plotting scatterplots and boxplots.

3. Descriptive_Stats.ipynb

A hands-on lab for calculating and understanding descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.

4. Regression_Analysis.ipynb

Demonstrates how regression analysis can be used as an alternative to t-tests, ANOVA, and correlation for statistical inference.

5. Hypothesis_Testing.ipynb

Provides a comprehensive overview of hypothesis testing, including stating hypotheses, Levene's Test, t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-square, and Pearson correlation.

6. Statistics for Data Science with Python.ipynb

A general notebook with various exercises covering descriptive statistics, probability, and hypothesis testing.

Review_introduction.ipynb

An introductory notebook focused on data acquisition from various sources and gaining basic insights using the Pandas library.

Project Case - Boston Housing Data Analysis (Week 6).ipynb

A project notebook that applies statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to the Boston Housing dataset to answer specific business questions.

Datasets
auto.csv: Dataset containing automobile specifications, used in Review_introduction.ipynb.

boston_housing.csv: The classic Boston Housing dataset, used in the Project Case - Boston Housing Data Analysis notebook.

teachingratings.csv: A dataset of teacher evaluations (including a "beauty" score) used in labs 1 through 6 for various statistical analyses.
